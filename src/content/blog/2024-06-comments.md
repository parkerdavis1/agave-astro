â‡£ [Look down there](#comments-section). There's a comment section now.

Leave a heartfelt message, ask a question, draw an ascii, [click on a quail](/blog/2024-05-27-quail). Go nuts.

## ASCII

Recently I've been enjoying asking ChatGPT to draw me ASCII art.

Here's a Western Kingbird:

```
      __
     /  \
    |    |
   /|   | \
  | |   |  |
  \|   |  /
   |   | /
    \__/
     ||
     ||
     ||
     /\
    /  \
```

A leopard:

```
  ,_         _,
   |\\.-"""-.//|
   \`         `/
  /    _   _    \
  |    a _ a    |
  \   (/_\_)   /
   \`   / \   `/
    |#  \_/  #|
    \#\  _  /#/
     \`-----'/
      |     |
      |     |
      |     |
      |     |
      |     |
     /      \
    /        \
   /    / \    \
  /     | |     \
 /     /   \     \
 \    /     \    /
  \  /       \  /
   \|         |/
    '         '

```

...and a Gambel's Quail:

```
  ,=.
  )  \
 /  . \
|   \_/|
 \     /\
  |   | |
  |   | |
  |   | |
  |   | |
  |   | |
  |   | |
  \   | |
   \  | |
    \ | |
     \|_|
```

This one really does it for me. It appears to be a plump quail-like bird but sans-beak and fused with a monolith. I love it.

<!-- Most of the time ChatGPT and its ilk are all-time bullshitters, which is sort of still the case here, but with these ASCII drawings I find in myself a weird mix of admiration & pity. The art has a different feel than GPT's typical sophomoric confidence. Good try lil bud. -->

## Comments

You can read more about the technical details of how I implemented comments in the [next post](/blog/2024-06-comments-2), if you can dig that.

But while you're here, what ASCIIs do you have to share? ([Try this out](https://asciiflow.com))
