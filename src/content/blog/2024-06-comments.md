This blog now has a comment section. Holler!

## ASCII

The comments are rendered with a monospaced font, so feel free to leave an ASCII art or two. I've been enjoying asking ChatGPT to draw me ASCII art lately.

Here's a Western Kingbird:

```
      __
     /  \
    |    |
   /|   | \
  | |   |  |
  \|   |  /
   |   | /
    \__/
     ||
     ||
     ||
     /\
    /  \
```

Octopus:

```
   ___
  / o o\
  \_  _/
    |||
    \|/
```

and my favorite, a Gambel's Quail:

```
  ,=.
  )  \
 /  . \
|   \_/|
 \     /\
  |   | |
  |   | |
  |   | |
  |   | |
  |   | |
  |   | |
  \   | |
   \  | |
    \ | |
     \|_|
```

This one really does it for me. It appears to be a plump bird sans-beak fused with a monolith. I love it.

Most of the time ChatGPT is just an all-time bullshitter, which is also the case here, but these give me a feeling of admiration/pity. It's trying and look how cute it is!

What ASCIIs do you have for me?
