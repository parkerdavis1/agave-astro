*Listers* is a comedic documentary film about two brothers who decide to do a Lower 48 Big Year in their 2010 Kia Sedona minivan to learn what birding is all about. The joys and absurdities of birding are on display in equals parts. 

From [Nicolas Lund's article in Slate](https://slate.com/culture/2025/09/listers-documentary-youtube-birding-birdwatching-movie-ebird.html):

> What many other birders and I love about *Listers* [...] is that it’s the first time we’ve seen “real” birding on screen. This is the birding of gas stations, ponds behind a women’s prison, and “the bird’s right there on the mud next to the Wiffle ball and the tire.”

> They have the kind of easygoing, infectious, and filthy banter that only exists between two siblings on a road trip, and the most enjoyable parts of the documentary [...] are the times when they’re just hanging out in their minivan. Quentin, with his mullet and drawl, is a natural in front of the camera, and Owen [...] balances the grainy handycam footage of the moments when the brothers are most beaten down with truly gorgeous, high-definition video of the birds they’ve found.

It deftly touches on so many aspects of birding culture with a sly grin and a wink. For birders, their trials and tribulations are just so relatable. There is a decent showing from the Arizona birding community as well -- props to Robert for being one of the most reasonable-seeming people interviewed in the movie. Did I mention it was funny? It is surprisingly funny. 

Give it a watch:
