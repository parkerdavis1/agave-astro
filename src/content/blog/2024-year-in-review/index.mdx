The first day of the year was dystopian. At sunrise, Nell and I went out to do [CAP-LTER](https://globalfutures.asu.edu/caplter/) bird counts in downtown Phoenix along the Salt River basin. The air was thick with smoke from fireworks and smog. Everywhere we went along the river reeked of sewage and trash. The vibes were terrible.

<br />

Nell and I went to the Chiricahuas in March to camp with our friend Iza. It snowed almost the entire time we were there. It was great.

<br />

As Nell and I decided whether to buy the house we live in and replace the roof in order to keep the house insured, the ground fell out from under my feet. One moment I was on solid ground, flagstone and concrete outside our kitchen window, next I was standing in a black greasy crater filled with mosquitos and roaches. I said to Nell, "This is a sign. We can't buy this house."

We decided to buy the house.

<br />

We went to Memphis/Arkansas to see the total solar eclipse in April with some old friends. I really can't recommend experiencing a total solar eclipse enough. [Nell published a beautiful lyrical essay](https://nellsmithwriter.com/2024/09/27/essay-in-southern-humanities-review-fragments-of-bone-fragments-of-light/) partly about our experience of the 2018 eclipse in Wyoming.

<br />

In July, roof work started in earnest. It was chaotic and stressful. Goose hated it.

House work or the threat of it lingered through October and we successfully secured home insurance.

<br />

In July, I turned 36 and my grandmother turned 101.

[I got a new job](/blog/2024-08-new-job/).

We got Goose a fancy water fountain. He loves it.

Nell got a beautiful wedding dress on discount from a very strange store in the Prescott Mall.

I had some pre-melanoma removed from my right shin by a very strange dermatologist.

Nell and I tripled or quadrupled our house plants. Nell mulched the yard. I built a [home](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/) [cooked](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software) plant watering app.

An old friend and my uncle both died suddenly in the fall and winter.

I became an eBird reviewer for Maricopa county.

I saw 9 life birds.

A lot happened. Some of it was great, some of it was terrible. A lot of it was stressful and a lot of groundwork was laid for a hopefully calmer, fruitful year ahead, at least in our corner of the world.

Here's lookin' at you 2025.
