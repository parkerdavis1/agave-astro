## Overview

I was brought on to consult on the site rebuild for CCAM but ended up building the entire site. [Ioan BuÈ›iu](https://www.ioan.website/) did a great job on the initial design.

## Noteworthy stuff that I will write about soon

- Gallery metadata template node script
- Intersection observer and lazy loading p5 library -> rewriting CCAM sketch in vanilla JS
- First time using container queries
- First time setting up 301 redirects
- Using [HTMZ](/blog/htmz) technique to load galleries; emitting custom DOM events to load lightbox script
- Slow mode for slower devices / prefers-reduced-motion
- Surprisingly tricky dashed CSS Grid spacers
